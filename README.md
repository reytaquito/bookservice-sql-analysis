# Book Service SQL Analysis

## ðŸ“„ Project Description

The COVIDâ€‘19 pandemic transformed daily routines worldwide, driving more people indoors to read books rather than visit cafÃ©s or malls. In response, startups launched applications tailored to book lovers.

This repository contains an exploratory SQL analysis of a book serviceâ€™s database, which includes tables for books, publishers, authors, customer ratings, and reviews. The aim is to derive insights that will inform a new productâ€™s value proposition.

Key deliverables:

1. **Data Exploration**  
   - Examine table structures and relationships.  
   - Profile record counts and key distributions (e.g. popular genres, active authors).  
2. **Business Questions**  
   - Identify topâ€‘rated books and authors.  
   - Determine publishers with highest average ratings.  
   - Analyze review activity over time.  
3. **SQL Scripts**  
   - Parameterized queries for each analysis.  
   - Views to simplify repeated reporting tasks.
